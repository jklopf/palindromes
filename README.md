## Abstract

*Timema* is a genus of stick insects, native to the West of the USA, that comprises both sexual and asexual species. In this genus, there is evidence of at least seven independent transitions from sexual to asexual reproduction. As asexual species are subject to Muller’s ratchet, avoiding it is necessary for the persistence of asexual lineages over long time periods. Studies on the human Y chromosome, also subject to Muller’s ratchet, suggest that one way to escape it involves gene conversion events driven by genomic palindromes. Collinearity analysis on two published genomes of asexual species suggests that they tend to accumulate palindromes, consistent with palindrome-driven gene conversion evidence of the human Y chromosome. In this study, we report the current counts of palindromes in sexual and asexual species of *Timema* stick insects and discuss trends on palindromes identification.
